# Drawmatic

---

Draw images using nothing but your webcam, a neural network, and your hand!

## Intro

This repository contains my final project for Harvard's CS50.
You too can enjoy this course by heading over to [the CS50 website](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/).

Drawmatic is built using Google's tensorflowjs [hand pose model](https://github.com/tensorflow/tfjs-models/tree/master/hand-pose-detection) and [bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).

## Assumptions

A few basic assumptions have been made:

- The camera is (reasonably) static
- While there are no limitations on the background, this software performs better when the user's hand is clearly distinguishable from the background
- Only one hand can be used to draw at a time, having multiple hands in frame can lead to the software randomly selecting one of them => try to only have one hand visible

---

## Usage

Drawmatic uses the hand pose model to detect the positions of your fingers. The tip of your index finger will be highlighted with a small circle at all times.

To activate draw mode pinch using thumb and index finger (like so ðŸ‘Œ), as soon as the tips touch the circle fills and you start drawing. Stop pinching to switch back to tracking mode and stop drawing.

Once you're satisfied with your artwork click `Snap!` to create a snapshot. You can also delete everything you drew by hitting `Reset` and start over.

### Pinch Detection

The Hand Pose model detects 20 key points: one for each finger segment, one at the wrist. In order to be flexible with regards to camera resolution this software uses a relative measure to detect a pinch:

```js
const ratio = dist(thumb tip, index tip) / length(last thumb segment);
const pinching = ratio < 1.1
```

### Drawing

The position of the marker (and other info, e.g. "pinch"/"no pinch") is recorded for every frame and its path drawn onto an HTML canvas, overlayed over the webcam feed.

Drawing every single point identified by the algorithm desribed above leads to a super jittery line, while pretty good the hand pose model is not perfect in identifying the key points.  
A significantly smoother line is achieved by averaging the position of the current marker and the previous one:

```js
const position[t] = (position[t] + position[t - 1]) / 2
```

Averaging over more than the last two positions leads to an even smoother line, but leads to the marker lagging considerably behind the actual finger position.

For snapshots a second canvas is created but not displayed.  
That way the marker can be hidden without adding unnecessary complex logic to the live feed.

## How to contribute

Open an issue to let me know what you want to tackle, then mention it in the PR.  
Alternatively: get inspired and build your own thing using whatever part of Drawmatic you like ðŸ˜Š

Have a look at the roadmap below to see which features I'd like to add in future release.

### Roadmap

1. Line smoothing âœ”
1. Button to reset image = delete path âœ”
1. Hide draw pointer when taking snapshot âœ”
1. Do some design stuff
   1. Probably with bootstrap âœ”
   1. Add icon âœ”
   1. Add "About" section to navbar âœ”
1. Try model (full/lite) and video size combinations for maximum performance
1. Deploy to github pages
   1. https://www.reddit.com/r/WebAssembly/comments/9297tg/wasm_and_github_pages/

#### v3

1. Allow different camera sizes
   1. https://css-tricks.com/updating-a-css-variable-with-javascript/
1. Easter egg: make peace sign to take snapshot
